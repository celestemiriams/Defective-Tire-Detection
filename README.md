# Defective-Tire-Detection
This repository contains the research for detecting defective tires using deep learning methods. Four models including Yolov9, Resnet, VGG19, and MobileNet were used and the two models with the best perforamce were ensembled to create a hybrid. Explainable AI techniques like Lime, and CAM were used to enhance the interpretability of the models
